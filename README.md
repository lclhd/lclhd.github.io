title: Jekyll Gitbook Theme

这是一个GitBook样式的Jekyll站点，主要用来记录我学习Photoshop过程中的零散知识点，如果用一般的样式来呈现，会非常难以辨别和索引这些零碎的知识点，GitBook样式完美解决了这些问题，这是我非常喜欢的。

GitBook is an amazing frontend style to present and organize contents (such as book chapters
and blogs) on Web. The typical to deploy GitBook at [Github Pages][1]
is building HTML files locally and then push to Github repository, usually to the `gh-pages`
branch. However, it's quite annoying to repeat such workload and make it hard for people do
version control via git for when there are generated HTML files to be staged in and out.

This theme takes style definition out of generated GitBook site and provided the template
for Jekyll to rendering markdown documents to HTML, thus the whole site can be deployed
to [Github Pages][1] without generating and uploading HTML bundle every time when there are
changes to the original repository.
